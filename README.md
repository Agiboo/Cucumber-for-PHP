# Cucumber for PHP

This is (yet another) attempt to integrate Cucumber and Gherkin in PHP.  Since there's no real Cucumber-based (BDD) framework in PHP, I've started to experiment with it. 

## Introduction

I'm just putting this online for other people to experiment with.  Here's a short list of things I would like to implement:

* Gherkin scenarios recognition & validation Ã  la Cucumber
* Running tests using the facebook implementation of webdriver (seems to me it's the cleanest implementation)
* Record tests
* Output test results (in raw output and JUnit so that it can be integrated in Jenkins)
* Suggest please!
